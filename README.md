i followed a layout to create a social media dashboard using react, flowbite and useStates.

Peer Comment: The Overall Design is Similar to the Prototype. The Fonts and Colors seem to match the ones that needed to be used. I tested both Desktop and Mobile and found only 3 small mistakes. The first one is the @ for instagram should make the "n" lowercase you wrote @realNathanf should be @realnathanf. Another one is the dark/light mode switch should have a hover effect on the greenish/blueish color look at the active-states-light jpg. Lastly the dark mode switch should be reversed when the circle is to the left it should be dark mode and when it is to the right it should be light mode and also both should filled in with the same greenish blue ish color and the circle should be the dark color on dark mode. Overall good work!
